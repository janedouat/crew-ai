## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system
- **API Key**: Anthropic API key for Claude (the AI model Jane uses)

### Step 1: Install UV Package Manager

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast dependency management. Install it first:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Step 2: Clone and Setup Project

```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MIT-AI-STUDIO

# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment automatically
- Install all required packages (CrewAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Set up the project structure

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Anthropic API key and model:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env

# Add your API key and model (replace with your actual values)
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here" >> .env
echo "MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620" >> .env
```

**Configuration details:**
- **API Key**: Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) to create an account and generate an API key
- **Model**: Choose from available Claude models:
  - `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620` (recommended - latest and most capable)
  - `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (faster, more cost-effective)
  - `claude-3-opus-20240229` (most powerful, slower)

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Test that everything is working:

```bash
# Run the interactive CLI
uv run janeai
```

You should see the Jane's Digital Twin menu appear!
