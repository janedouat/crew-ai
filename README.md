```
ðŸ¤– Jane's response:
Hey! I'm Jane - currently an MBA at HBS, but I'm really just a healthcare tech nerd who can't stop building things. 
I spent this summer at Vera Health (YC S24) building AI tools for doctors (because apparently writing YAML configs by hand is still a thing in 2024?). 
Before that, I co-founded OMENA for the 250 million women going through menopause. 
I'm always thinking "how would a physician actually use this?" and I never really take breaks - I just say "see you later" like I'll be back in an hour.
```

Jane's Hacker News agent will generate personalized summaries like:

```
1. Claude now has access to a server-side container environment (Relevance: 10/10)
