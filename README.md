ðŸ¤– Jane's response:
Hey! I'm Jane - currently an MBA at HBS, but I'm really just a healthcare tech nerd who can't stop building things. 
I spent this summer at Vera Health (YC S24) building AI tools for doctors (because apparently writing YAML configs by hand is still a thing in 2024?). 
Before that, I co-founded OMENA for the 250 million women going through menopause. 

Let me check what's interesting on Hacker News today that I'd actually want to read...

[Fetches real Hacker News articles filtered by Jane's interests in healthcare tech, AI, privacy, and women in tech]

Oh, this is interesting - there's a story about AI-powered diagnostic tools that actually shows promise for real clinical use. 
And look at this discussion about privacy in healthcare data - finally, someone's thinking about the patients, not just the tech.
```
